## A mini-game for guessing charting songs between 1960 and 2019

The game selects a random week from a random year within a range of years chosen by the user.

Up to 100 songs can be queried, and it is the user's goal to guess the name of each song of the chart for that week
provided the artist name, the chart position, and the chart date. The user is shown a series of blanks corresponding
to letters in the song name and must choose from a bank of letters until all the blanks are filled. If the users
incorrectly selects four letters for a song, the user does not get a point.
